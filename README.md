Hi this was my project for 16-811-> Popularly Robo math in CMU <br/>
In this I implmented image compression for big images using 3 popular SVD techniques - Compressed SVD, Random SVD and Old fashined SVD <br/>
Pls check the PPT and report for results. (Due to size limitation could not upload the bigger reuslts <br/>
Enjoy!
